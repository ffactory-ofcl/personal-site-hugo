I've been working at studo for 
Studo is a student companion app that gives you easy access to your study calendar, grades, chat and much more. 
Last semester, I created a survey creation framework as part of my work at [Studo](https://studo.com/). 

The survey tool is integrated into the Studo Newsroom architecture and allows us and our company partners to create surveys, which can then be published to the Studo Newsfeed and filled out by students. Check out this article with [more info about the survey creation framework]({{< ref "/projects/survey-creation-framework" >}}). To analyze its performance, I will pit it against other solutions like [Google Forms](https://forms.google.com/) and [SurveyJS](https://surveyjs.io/).
