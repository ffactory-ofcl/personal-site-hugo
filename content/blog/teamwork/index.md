One day, a few months ago, a friend of mine came up with a new project idea. We hopped on a discord call and he pitched it us. We're a group of four friends who met while studying [Mobile Software Development]({{< ref "/blog/bachelors-takeaways" >}}). But this article is not about that project idea, but rather about how we started to work in a team, what our organization and structure looks like.

Working as a developer is part of our study programme, so our time is split between classes and work. Thankfully, there are fewer classes in the last semester, which we're currently in. More time to focus on our project! :)

# It starts with the idea
The project idea was born out of the pain of trying to schedule a time to meet friends. But to get everyone on the same page about what exactly that meant for each one of us turned out to be more difficult than expected. Everyone thought they "got" it, but each one was actually thinking of a slightly different goal. We're no fans of endless meetings, but as it turns out, we needed one to get to a shared understanding of our goal.

We identified two flows of how users would interact with the app. It was all too tempting to dive right into the details of the *how* and start discussing technologies we could use. We managed to resist most of that, but of course not all.

All of us work as developers, but luckily each one has different areas of interest and priorities of work. There's a guy who's very into testing and task management, a backend dev and the guy who had the idea (and willingness to learn). Lastly, there's me üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I will talk about my areas of focus later.
