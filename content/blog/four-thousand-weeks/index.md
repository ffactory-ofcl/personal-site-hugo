I've recently been reading the book "Four thousand weeks - time management for mortals" after seeing it recommended on hackernews. 

# The core insights of the book
- perspective
    - on human life and how short it is
    - on what might be important in your life and what might not be
- finitude
    - having limited time is what makes life special. Making a choice is all the more meaningful because of all the other options that were not chosen
- it may not be best to see time as a resource
- some helpful insights into traps that people tend to fall into
    - living for the future
        -> life is short, maybe much shorter than we think. It's neither "every day as your last" or wandering aimlessly, nor working for retirement, hyper focused. Need to strike a balance between the two.
        - wanting to keep every option "open" 
            -> but actually waiting leads to just missing out on most options
        - 
    - thinking that _one day_ I will clear all items off our to-do list
        -> the list of possible tasks is endless. Getting faster at clearing them will just make new tasks pile on faster.
    - not realizing that lots of seemingly small tasks chip away at life's duration more than I would think
        -> they break time ranges  into 
    - forgetting to make time for myself / thinking about life and what's important
    
- what the book does good, what it does bad
- im not done with it lol
- what is most useful for me / what i've changed about my outlook/behaviour in life through that book

> "There is no time, so short is life, for bickerings, heartburn and apologies. There's only time for loving, and but an instant, so to speak, for that."
